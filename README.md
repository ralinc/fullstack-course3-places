###Ruby on Rails: Advanced MongoDB Ruby Driver Topics

This assignment will evaluate your ability to implement a data tier using some of the more advanced MongoDB Ruby Driver 

Topics discussed during this module. It is lengthy -- but much of the length is the result of providing:

* extensive examples that seek to further explain what is being asked to implement
* demonstrations of how you can interactively look at your in-progress solution and self-evaluate the result

The overall goal of the assignment is to:

* Implement a model class and a set of supporting classes to represent a complex type for a collection.
* Implement standard queries
* Implement aggregation pipeline queries
* Create an index and implement geolocation queries
* Implement GridFS file storage and retrieval
* Implement and navigate a relationship from a model class
* Demonstrate the data tier's ability to serve content to the web
* Demonstrate the data tier's ability to leverage relationships between collections to the web.
